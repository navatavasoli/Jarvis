## What if I Just Have a Question?

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue just to ask a question. 
1. Read the README, and see if that answers you.
2. Read this whole document.
If you still have a question, search existing issues and you may find that there's a topic similar to that of your question. You can ask your question as a comment in that issue.
