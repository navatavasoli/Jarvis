- HOW TO EXTEND JARVIS:
 If you would like to add extra functionality to Jarvis (for example new actions like "record" etc.) you only need to add this action to the action dict (look on __init__(self) in Jarvis.py) along with a apropriate function name. Then you need to implement this function as a local function on reactions() method.
