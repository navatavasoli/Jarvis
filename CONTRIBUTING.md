## What if I Just Have a Question?

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue just to ask a question. 
1. Read the README, and see if that answers you.
2. Read this whole document.
If you still have a question, search existing issues and you may find that there's a topic similar to that of your question. You can ask your question as a comment in that issue.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Here's some guidelines to help maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you may find that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same problem you're experiencing, open a new issue and try and link to the original issue.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Read the README and the documentation to check if you missed something.
* Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Jarvis.
* **Perform a quick search in [issues](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis/issues)** to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?

Bugs are recorded as [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Explain the problem and include details to help maintainers reproduce the problem, and to help contributers fix it:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem
* **Describe the steps which produce the problem** in as much detail as possible
* **Describe what was wrong** with the behavior you observed
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens
* Include details about your configuration and environment. What OS are you using? What command line program was Jarvis running in? The more detail the better

### Suggesting Enhancements and Features

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating feature suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-feature-suggestion). You may find that you don't need to create one. When creating a suggestion, [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-suggest-a-feature).

#### Before Submitting A Feature Suggestion

* **Check if that feature already exists**
* **Check if you have the latest version** of Jarvis
* **Perform a [quick search](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis/issues)** to see if the feature/enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A Feature Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion
* **Use the tag new_feature** in the issue
* **Provide a description of the suggested feature**
