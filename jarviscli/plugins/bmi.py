    Welcome to the Body Mass Index plugin documentation! Here you can find all the functionalitites

    Usage: Type bmi, press enter and follow the instructions
    Functionalities: You can calculate your BMI both on metric and imperial system.
    For metric system: Type your height in centimetres and the your weight in kilos,
        they should be both Integers!
    For imperial system: Type your height in feets and inches and then your weight in lbs
        all measurements should be Integers!
    Find out your BMI number and your body state.
